Social Media Performance Analysis - Pre-Hackathon Assignment Overview

The Social Media Performance Analysis project is a basic analytics tool developed for the Level Supermind Hackathon Pre-Hackathon Assignment. The tool uses Langflow, DataStax Astra DB, and Groq to analyze engagement data from mock social media accounts and provide insights into how different post types (carousel, reels, static images) perform in terms of likes, shares, and comments. The project aims to help users understand how various social media formats impact engagement metrics. Hackathon Details
